## Time to read my books
[Medium: MISSION.ORG](https://medium.com/the-mission/how-to-read-50-books-per-year-without-really-trying-even-if-youre-a-super-slow-reader-56d65191c3)
2019 was supposed to be 30 books. So time needed to read after doing the WPM test:
```
30 books x 50,000 words/book = 1.5 million words
1.5 million words / 162 WPM = 9260 minutes
9260 minutes / 60 each hour = 155 hours
155 hours / 365 days = 26.4 minutes per day
```

Now that I've done only 10 books 
```
20 books x 50,000 words/book = 1 million words
1 million words / 162 WPM = 6173 minutes
6173 minutes / 60 each hour = 102 hours
102 hours / 113 days = 54.6 minutes per day
```

I need to spend an hour a day reading!
